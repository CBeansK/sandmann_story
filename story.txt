In a small biergarten in Raesfeld, they sell a type of magical bratwurst. 
Nearby someone was blasting Rammstein while choking on gebaecks.
Gebaecks are not my favorite so I instead decided to grab a bratwurst.
After eating the magical bratwurst we decided to do some shopping on the Hauptstrasse in Raesfeld.
